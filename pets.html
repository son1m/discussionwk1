            <div class = content>
            <p>I adopted kitty in October of 2022 from the local animal shelter, we speculate he is a Siberian cat or a Mainecoon mix but did not know that at the time.</p> 
            <P>Kitty can be described as a very excitable and sassy little boy. He is extremely motivated by food and loves occasional belly rubs. There are many times where he likes to chase our dog Manolo around the house, although Manolo does not like it.</P>

            <div class = content>
            <p>My family adopted Manolo in October of 2017 from the local pet store, we speculate he is a long haired Dachshund mix. At the time of his adoption we were told that he originally came from Puerto Rico and was found on a soccer field.</p> 
            <P>Manolo can be described as a very relaxed and calm dog. He is a bit clumsy and if the snow is too cold when he is outside he will just plop over. Overall, his favourite family member is my mother and he spends his days lounging around when he is not being chased by kitty.</p>

            <p>My family adopted Peep alongside Manolo from the same local petstore. He recently passed but he was a very happy and playful parakeet!</p> 
            <P>Peep can be described as a very talkative guy, he enjoyed having the layout of his cage changed and new toys moved in different locations.</p>
